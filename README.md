# React Simple Props Movie Lab

## Objectives

- Practice passing props from parent components to children

## Introduction

This is a bare-bones React application used to showcase the nine greatest movies
of all time. Our job is to update it so that it passes props from the parent to
children components correctly. In addition, we will implement default props so
that 'bad/missing data' is properly handled - preventing our user interface from
blowing up our visitors' computers

Following is the component tree. When fully rendered, there are **9**
`MovieCards` rendered by `MovieShowcase`:

```text
└── MovieShowcase
    └─ MovieCard
       └─ CardFront
```

`MovieShowcase` is the component that will house all of the 'raw' data
associated with the movies we want to display. This data is located in
`src/data.js` and is already being imported.

`MovieCard` components (which showcase a single movie) receive their individual
movie information from `MovieShowcase` as two props: `title` and `genres`.
Following that, the props are passed again to `CardFront`.

In our movie data set, we occasionally have missing data. This is where
`defaultProps` come in and save us some grief. We will be handling the creation
of our `defaultProps` in `MovieCard` before they are passed down
the chain to the `CardFront` component.

## Deliverables

###### `MovieShowcase`

To get started, take a look at `src/data.js` to get a sense of the data you'll
be working with. We can see that the data is stored in an array of objects. At
the end of this file, the data is exported. In `src/MovieShowcase.js`, we can
see that this data gets imported at the top:

```js
import movieData from './data.js'
```

The `MovieShowcase` component now has access to our data in the `movieData` variable.
We want to take this data and, for every object inside, render a `MovieCard` component,
passing the object data in as props like so:

```js
generateMovieCards = () => {
  return movieData.map((movie, index) =>
    <MovieCard
      key={index} // Unique key required by React when returning an array of JSX elements
      title={movie.title}
      genres={movie.genres}
    />
  )
};
```

In JSX, it is possible to include JavaScript code and calls to functions. A function
called in JSX must be wrapped in curly braces and must return either a single JSX element,
or an array that contains multiple JSX elements. A single JSX element, however, can contain
other elements.

This is what we are doing with `movieData`: mapping over the data and passing in values from
each object as props. See the [documentation here][lists-and-keys] for additional information.

Once we have our function that generates an array of MovieCard components we need to
invoke that function in our render function as mentioned above:

```js
render() {
  return <div id="movie-showcase">{this.generateMovieCards()}</div>;
}
```

###### `MovieCard`

If everything is set up properly in `MovieShowcase`, running the application
will produce a page with 9 empty squares on the page. These are the nine
`MovieCard` components being rendered in `MovieShowcase`.

If we were to place `console.log(this.props)` in the `MovieCard` component at
the beginning of `render()`, we'd see that each `MovieCard` contains different
props. Our next task here is to pass props to the child component of `MovieCard`,
`CardFront`.

`CardFront` will display the title and genres. Therefore it needs to receive the
`title` and `genre` props. Lets take a look at how this works:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <CardFront
        title={this.props.title}
        genres={this.props.genres}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Thinking about the structure of this application, `CardFront` has a specific
task - to display the data it receives as props. `MovieShowcase` is where
this data is imported. So, what is the purpose of `MovieCard`?

In this case, `MovieCard` acts as a sort of container. It does render a `div`
element with a CSS class, but aside from that, its primary purpose is to house
the `CardFront` component.

In addition to containing `CardFront`, the `MovieCard` component can also be used to
make sure that the data being passed down to `CardFront` is complete. For this,
we use default props. Default props allow us to set a default value in the
event that a prop is not provided. By doing this in `MovieCard`, we can ensure
that the props passed down to `CardFront` are consistent.

Lets write `defaultProps` like this:

```js
MovieCard.defaultProps = {
  title: 'Unknown',
  genres: ['No Genre(s) Found'],
};
```

Review the previous Props readme for an example on default props, and/or take a
look at the [documentation][default props] for additional guidance.

###### `CardFront`

In this component, we need to render the `title` and `genres`. Remember that `genres`
is an array of multiple genres so we will have to join them into a single string,
separated by commas. Lets take a look at how we can do that in our render function:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3 className="title">Title: {this.props.title}</h3>
      <h5 className="genres">Genre(s): {this.props.genres.join(', ')}</h5>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Once Finished

Check out the application and make sure everything is functioning how you expect it to!
You can do this by running `npm install` and then start the react server with `npm start`.
Be sure to make sure you are passing your tests before moving on!
